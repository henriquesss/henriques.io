<p>After long years of inefficient learning at programming area, I start my studies about how to study (yes, that‚Äôs it) and I reach some interesting concepts about ‚Äòdemands‚Äô. It‚Äôs probably looks like obvious, but I only take this serious a couple of years ago, so, I hope you see the value I saw on this content.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I will not talk about specific study techniques such as Pomodoro or Flash Cards, but a Macro vision of this and the effect of some strategies to your career development.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As a software engineers, the behavior of study is a common thing in our routines, but, you already asked yourself if this studies are efectives? With this question in mind, I want to show you two concepts:</p>

## On demand study

<p>This approach is based at Premise: ‚ÄúIf you have an issue at your 9-6 job, let‚Äôs study this after work to fix the problem‚Äù. It‚Äôs nothing wrong with this protocol, but it will help you for a short time only and I explain why: The tech market demands change too quickly, with same stuff updated or new concepts and frameworks.</p>

<p>Ex: If you are stuck into a ticket to update a JWT code, you will study JWT and, maybe, authentication at all.</p>

<p>So, If you study only when a problem appears, you will learn a lot of concepts and real life problems, but you never be PREPARED before the new problems of your company (and problems you haven't solved yet). Got it?</p>

<p>This rhythm probably not make you lost your job, but expose you to a dumb risk. I‚Äôl draw for you. </p>

<p>The graphic shows a ‚Äògap‚Äô between your company demand and the market demand. Keep your eyes on it!</p>

## Active study

<p>Now, we gonna talk about to accompany the market trends of your language, tech stack or the concepts of your domain (front, back, mobile, devOps, security, etc..). I know, it‚Äôs impossible to study every new stuff in the tech bubble (mainly if you are a JavaScript engineer with 845 new frameworks each week), but if you keep looking the trends and advancing in your own study plan (language, tool or concept), you can accumulate a ‚Äòknowledge delta‚Äô (the orange indicator in the image below)</p>

<p>If you grow your delta, you can convert this into a lot of benefits, such as:</p>
- More knowledge to share with your team (you gain more visibility)
- More security at your job (because you are a more valuable engineer now and you got less probability to get fired)
- More job proposals (if you share what you are studying at Linkedin or other network)
- More repertoire to handle with new issues in your job and side projects
- And if you have a business:
    - More options to handle with your actual problems
    - More services you can provide (or features to your product)
    - A innovation, who knows


## Gold tip
<p>Publish your code at Github and talk about it on LinkedIn. Thank me later üòâ</p>

## Conclusion
<p>Lifelong learning is a buzzword to a routine to us, software engineers, that‚Äôs it. So keep your eyes open to new stuff and follow your study plans and roadmaps.

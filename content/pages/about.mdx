# Why this website has been made?

## Centralization

I needed a place that wasn't just a blog, but where I could centralize as many things as possible that go through my head, such as ideas, projects, studies, things that I will need to consult constantly, more crazy ideas and so on.

## Descentralization

There are several blogging platforms nowadays, such as Medium or dev.to, however, I really wanted to have a space on the internet that was mine, even if it is still within the Vercel infrastructure, pointing to an AWS machine and finally, in a data center in Northern California (probably)


## Knowledge

What do Leonardo Da Vinci, Julius Caesar and these great minds of history have in common? They wrote. And not only that, they shared knowledge as a way to improve personal and intellectual aspects and also to contribute to the construction of humanity's knowledge (even if just a little)

## You were too lazy to style the site ?

The focus here is the content, so I need nothing to disturb your attention, which is currently divided between 10 tabs in the browser and a tiktok buzzing on your cell phone
